# Summary of findings on the Rosen


The RosenBridge workshops are a series of collaborative sessions aimed at engaging Cardano Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) in the development and implementation of the Rosen Bridge, a cross-chain interoperability solution. These workshops are instrumental in laying the foundation for the Rosen Bridge SPO Toolkit and ensuring that the Cardano ecosystem benefits from this initiative. The overarching goal is to provide a new revenue stream for SPOs while bolstering the security and functionality of the Rosen Bridge.

So far, we have conducted 4 workshops with the SPO community and we are planning on doing more. Hereâ€™s a recap of the 4 workshops we have conducted so far:

## First Workshop: Foundations and Token Evaluation

- **Introduction:** The session commenced with an overview of the Rosen Bridge SPO Toolkit and its significance in the Project Catalyst Fund 10 proposal.
- **Tiered Pricing Mechanism:** A robust discussion on the tiered pricing for tokens to be onboarded onto the Rosen Bridge was held.
- **Token Evaluation Systems:** Rick McCracken introduced a token evaluation system from DripDropz, while Minswap's community-driven evaluation system was also explored.
- **Community Engagement:** The importance of broadening community engagement was emphasized, with suggestions for future workshops.
- **Call to Action:** SPOs were encouraged to disseminate the knowledge gained, emphasizing community awareness and transparency.

**Key Findings:** The need for a simplified, yet robust token evaluation system was identified. The importance of community engagement and transparency was underscored!

## Second Workshop: RosenBridge Mechanics and Tokenomics

- **Opening Remarks:** Theodore highlighted the community's support for the F10 proposal and discussed broadening the workshop's reach.
- **RosenBridge Deep Dive:** Mhs\_Sam provided an extensive overview of Rosen's design principles, its operational mechanics, the role of watchers, and the challenges faced by bridges.
- **RSN Tokenomics:** A comprehensive discussion on the utility, application, and significance of the RSN token within RosenBridge was conducted, ensuring clarity on its role in the ecosystem.

**Key Findings:** The critical role of watchers in ensuring the bridge's security was emphasized. The potential of the RSN token in driving utility and value within the ecosystem was recognized.

## Third Workshop: RSN Tokenomics and Community Engagement

- **RSN Tokenomics Exploration:** Joe Armeanio delved deeper into RSN tokenomics, discussing its total supply, functions, Rosen permits for SPOs, and the upcoming ERGO IDO and Cardano ISPO.
- **Community Initiatives:** The session emphasized the goal of ensuring a fair distribution of RSN tokens, promoting broader community engagement, and reinforcing the commitment to decentralization.
- **Resources:** Attendees were provided with slides and materials from the workshop, ensuring they had access to all pertinent information.[Workshop recording](https://youtu.be/DLJ3a--bIbc)

  **Key Findings:** The importance of a fair distribution mechanism for RSN tokens was highlighted. The potential of community-driven initiatives in reinforcing decentralization was acknowledged.


## Fourth Workshop: Watchers, Liquidity, and Future Directions


- **Watchers and Scaling Rosen:** A detailed exploration of the role and mechanics of watchers in scaling and securing the RosenBridge.
- **Liquidity Bootstrapping:** Strategies and the importance of liquidity in the ecosystem were discussed, highlighting its pivotal role in the bridge's functionality.
- **Listing Tokens and Fee Distribution:** An in-depth discussion on token listings and the mechanism for fee distribution, ensuring clarity and transparency in the process.
- **Q&A Session:** A dedicated segment for SPOs to raise questions, ensuring that all concerns and feedback were addressed comprehensively.
- **Resources**: [Workshop recording](https://youtu.be/4VzIfzHQrl4)

**Key Findings:** The significance of liquidity in ensuring the bridge's smooth operation was recognized. The need for a transparent and equitable fee distribution mechanism was emphasized.

Throughout these workshops, the emphasis remained on collaborative decision-making, transparency, and active SPO involvement. The workshops serve as a testament to the commitment to making RosenBridge a robust, secure, and community-driven project that effectively serves both the Ergo and Cardano ecosystems. We are committed to keep pushing and moving forward.
